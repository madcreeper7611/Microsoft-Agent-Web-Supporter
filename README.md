# Microsoft-Agent-Web-Scripter
Small program that allows Microsoft Agent Scripting Helper scripts to be ran on modern web browsers using a custom URL protocol. Works on any browser that allows for custom protocols (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, and more)

## How to use
MAWS is extremely simple to use. Just download and run the installer, and you're all good! MAWS works by loading MASH files from a URL and running them. Once the script is over, each character in the script will hide and MAWS will close on it's own. MAWS also allows for characters to greet you on holidays.
